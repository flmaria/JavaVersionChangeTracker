# JavaVersionChangeTracker

JavaVersionChangeTracker is a comprehensive project that showcases code changes, improvements, and new features introduced in each version of Java. The best way to learn and put these Java enhancements into practice—and to improve your programming skills with the latest versions—is by implementing them directly. This project facilitates that by providing practical examples of implementation.

## Project Structure

Each Java version's changes and features are organized under the `io.github.flmaria` package. Within this package:
- Each Java version has its own dedicated sub-package.
- Each sub-package contains a runnable `Main.java` class that demonstrates the usage of the new features and improvements introduced in that specific version.
- The examples are designed to be simple and illustrative, allowing you to run and observe the output directly.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- **Java 20**: This project requires Java 20 as it leverages the latest language features and improvements.
- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management, particularly for managing the SLF4J logger dependency.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaVersionChangeTracker.git
